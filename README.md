In this app you can view and compare the median wages of those with a high school degree and a bachelor's degree.
The first page is an overview of the data including a random sample of the data. The second page displays a plot 
with reactive widgets in which you can change the points plotted, connect the lines, and change the color. You can
also display both lines at the same time so you can get a side by side comparison. The last page displays a reactive
data table that has all the median wages listed from 1990-2019. You can use the widget on the side to change from 
the wages of a high school degree and a bachelor's degree. This PS took me a few hours. Have fun exploring my app.
